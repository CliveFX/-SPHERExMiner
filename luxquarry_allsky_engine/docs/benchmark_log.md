## 2026-06-28: Manifest Smoke

Command:

```bash
cd luxquarry_allsky_engine
.venv/bin/luxquarry-allsky build-manifest \
  --input-root /mnt/niroseti/spherex_cache/raw/qr2/level2 \
  --out runs/manifest_smoke_v2/frame_manifest.parquet \
  --campaign-id manifest_smoke_v2 \
  --limit 10
```

Result:

```text
frame_count: 10
fits_total_bytes: 716,368,320
total_wall_sec: 0.260
discover_fits: 0.074 sec
read_headers: 0.176 sec
write_manifest: 0.007 sec
```

Notes:

- The FITS path layout includes a detector directory:
  `raw/qr2/level2/<planning_period>/<processing_version>/<detector>/<file>.fits`.
- The manifest parser now extracts planning period/version from the path and
  exposure/frame/detector from the filename.
- Header/WCS extraction is currently CPU/Astropy and already appears as a
  >5% stage, so it remains on the acceleration audit list. It is acceptable for
  now because Astropy is the correctness reference.
